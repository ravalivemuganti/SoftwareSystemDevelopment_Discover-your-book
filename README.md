# SoftwareSystemDevelopment_Discover-your-book
We developed an application that solves the problem of a student, who searches  enormously for the books suggested by the domain specific professors. In this project we made it easier for such students, by suggesting the books they need without putting much efforts. The search is not just limited to a particular university, itâ€™s global and one can find a book depending upon his/her capabilities, suggested by the domain specific professors from different universities.
